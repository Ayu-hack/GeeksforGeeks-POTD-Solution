You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

Example 1:


Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104


  solution:
// we used a two pointer approch and we did using area formula

class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length-1;
        int maxArea= 0;
        while(left < right){
            int currArea = Math.min(height[left],height[right])*(right -left);
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea,currArea);

            if(height[left]<height[right]){
                left++;
            }
            else{
                right--;
            }
        }
         return maxArea;
    }
   
}
